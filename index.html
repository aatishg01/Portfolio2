                        <h1>Modular Multi-Deformation Mode Soft Pneumatic Actuators</h1>
                        <p><strong>Rowan Robotics &amp; Human Machine Interactions Lab</strong> | September 2022 - December 2022</p>
                        <p>This work is published in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924424724008240" class="link">Sensors and Actuators A: Physical</a>.</p>
                        <p>Modular soft robots have the advantage in their ability to be reconfigured and change their morphology on-demand according to a specified task. The actuator design and particularly the inter-unit connectivity strength commonly govern the usability and functionality of these modular robots and their applications. In this paper, we present development of reconfigurable modular rotary soft actuators that allow the construction of highly versatile soft robotic actuators and systems. These pneumatically driven modular actuators are composed of an inner balloon and a flexible arched reinforcement structure to produce a rotary motion. They serve as building blocks which may be combined in various configurations to construct linear assemblies capable of extensile or bending motions. The connection scheme allows for the larger actuators to grow or shrink with the addition or removal of modules. Using finite element simulations and physical characterizations, we systematically explore the mechanical response of individual modular actuators and the role of various connection schemes on their motions upon pressurization. A key conceptual contribution of this work lies in the idea that for a modular soft robotic system, offsetting and tuning actuator alignment relative to an axis of symmetry can lead to substantial changes in mechanical performance. Utilizing these modules we demonstrate the reconfigurability of this modular system by both reconfiguring a large actuator into a pair of smaller actuators that can grasp delicate objects, and reconfiguring actuators to develop a linear crawling robot.</p>

                        <h1>Dense Object Cloud SLAM (DOCS): High-Fidelity Semantic Object Cloud Maps for Autonomous Inspection and Exploration</h1>
                        <p><strong>Carnegie Mellon University CERLAB</strong> | January 2024 - May 2025</p>
                        <p>Multi-modally equipped robots have emerged as assets in industrial applications through autonomous exploration and inspection capabilities. Existing approaches rely on simplified geometric representations that are resource efficient but sacrifice environmental fidelity and lack robust mechanisms for cross-robot collaboration in decentralized networks. To address these gaps, we present a decentralized semantic SLAM framework that enables robots to construct high-fidelity object-centric maps using dense point clouds rather than abstract primitives. Our system introduces three innovations: (1) a hierarchical metric-semantic representation combining sparse landmark graphs for long-term SLAM with on-demand dense point clouds for detailed inspection, (2) semantics-driven place recognition enabling map merging across robots with diverse sensors (LiDAR/RGBD), and (3) a modular and framework that can be combined with existing frameworks for use in distributed mapping by heterogeneous robots. We validate DOCS on a UAV platform equipped with LiDAR and RGBD sensors, demonstrating its ability to generate dense, semantically labeled object maps with mean cloud-to-cloud distances as low as 0.9 cm and completeness rates above 83% for key objects compared to ground truth scans. These results establish DOCS as a promising approach for high-precision, object-aware mapping in industrial environments, laying the groundwork for future extensions to dynamic scene understanding and broader deployment in real-world autonomous systems.</p>

                        <p><a href="https://sites.google.com/rowan.edu/mtrkov/home?authuser=0" class="link">Rowan Robotics &amp; Human Machine Interactions Lab</a><br>
                        September 2022 – December 2022</p>
                        <p>In 2022, collaborating with Rowan University dance professor Leslie Bush and Dr. Mitja Trkov, my team developed wearable soft robotic actuators for a dance performance aiming to create an organic, alien "breathing" effect on dancers' bodies. Using 3D printed translucent TPU accordion structures internally lit by LEDs and actuated by servo-spooled fishing line, alongside IMUs to capture dancer movement, we sought to have the actuators expand and contract in response to motion. Despite severe constraints from a tight deadline and limited personnel, which forced compromises on the IMU integration and consistent actuation functionality needed for full interactive deployment, we successfully produced and mounted over 30 visually striking actuator units with integrated LEDs onto the costumes. Ultimately, while the envisioned motion-responsive breathing mechanism wasn't fully realized across all units for the final show, the actuators' organic form and lighting significantly enhanced the choreography, resulting in a mesmerizing performance, and I take particular pride in how the core visual design I created contributed to its unique aesthetic impact.</p>

                        <p>As the manager for a six-student capstone team, I led the development of an autonomous locomotive soft robot for the virtual RoboSoft 2022 terrestrial competition, tasked with navigating an obstacle course unaided. Despite starting before final competition guidelines were released, creating ambiguous design parameters, we successfully engineered a novel solution using a McKibben air muscle paired with a 3D printed PETG spring for expansion/contraction-based locomotion, steered via servo-actuated "flapping" mechanisms and guided by IR obstacle avoidance. This bio-inspired robot achieved functional locomotion on flat surfaces and demonstrated limited capability on sand/loose terrain. By effectively delegating tasks and navigating the uncertain requirements, our team delivered a fully operational robot for competition day, earning recognition as the best Junior/Senior Clinic: Research project within the Rowan Mechanical Engineering department.</p>

                        <p>24-718 Computational Fluid Dynamics | Carnegie Mellon University<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>For our Computational Fluid Dynamics final project, we developed a practical 2D finite-difference solver to optimize inert gas flow within a Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) build chamber, directly addressing key manufacturing challenges like spatter removal and thermal management for part quality. By simulating various inlet and outlet positions on progressively refined grids (20x20 then 40x40), we identified the optimal configuration for balancing gas speed (>2 m/s average over the build plate to clear spatter) and temperature control (to minimize residual stresses): a bottom-flush inlet (0.0-0.1m height) combined with a top-positioned outlet (0.3-0.4m height). This specific setup provides the most effective flow path for shielding gas, offering actionable design guidance for LPBF machine builders seeking to enhance build reliability and part performance. While simplified (using modified argon properties and a static melt point), our study conclusively demonstrates the critical impact of inlet/outlet placement and provides a foundation for future work exploring complex configurations or true gas properties to further refine LPBF process efficiency.</p>

                        <p>16-782 Planning and Decision-Making in Robotics | Carnegie Mellon University<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>We present a multi-UAV system for autonomous search and rescue in crowded, unknown indoor environments. Each UAV, equipped with lidar, collaboratively builds a global 3D occupancy map. A core innovation is a multi-goal Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) planner, proven to exhibit asymptotic completeness with increasing UAV count—overcoming probabilistic incompleteness in single-goal RRT. Goals are selected via a Next Best Viewpoint (NBV) algorithm targeting maximal information gain for map exploration. The Hungarian algorithm optimally assigns dynamically feasible goals (from the RRT solutions) to UAVs, idling unreachable drones. Extensive MATLAB simulations validate the approach, showing the multi-goal RRT's scalability and completeness. While effective, NBV offered marginal gains over random selection in tested scenarios.</p>

                        <p>16-745 Optimal Control and Reinforcement Learning | Carnegie Mellon University<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>This project demonstrates stable quadrupedal locomotion without force sensing on resource-constrained hardware (ESP32) using a dual-stage MPC framework. We combine offline trajectory optimization via MuJoCo MJPC—generating stable gaits and autonomous recovery maneuvers such as self-righting from falls—with online embedded control through TinyMPC. Experimental results show that TinyMPC achieves 3× greater displacement than PID tracking of reference trajectories, while MJPC successfully synthesizes dynamically feasible gaits and recovery behaviors in simulation.

                            However, hardware deployment reveals a sim-to-real gap: insufficient foot clearance in optimized gaits causes stumbling on irregular surfaces, and actuator latency limits the transfer of recovery maneuvers. Despite these challenges, our framework validates the viability of force-sensor-free locomotion on microcontrollers, with TinyMPC enabling efficient real-time re-optimization. This work provides a foundation for deploying advanced MPC-based control on low-cost robotic platforms.</p>

                        <p>The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for aerial tasks and environmental manipulation is increasingly desired. This can be demonstrated via art tasks. This paper presents the development of Magnasketch, capable of translating image inputs into art on a magnetic drawing board via a Bitcraze Crazyflie 2.0 quadrotor. Optimal trajectories were generated using a Model Predictive Control (MPC) formulation newly incorporating magnetic force dynamics. A Z-compliant magnetic drawing apparatus was designed for the quadrotor. Experimental results of the novel controller tested against the existing Position High Level Commander showed comparable performance. Although slightly outperformed in terms of error, with average errors of 3.9 cm, 4.4 cm, and 0.5 cm in x, y, and z respectively, the Magnasketch controller produced smoother drawings with the added benefit of full state control.</p>
